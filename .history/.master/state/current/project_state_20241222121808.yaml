  TD001:
    title: Repository Structure
    date: '2024-01-24'
    status: accepted
    context: Need to organize integration of two upstream repositories
    decision: |
      Adopt monorepo structure with clean forks as submodules:
      - packages/
        - bridge/
        - cursor-chat-browser/
        - local-history/
    rationale: |
      - Enables clean upstream syncs
      - Maintains separation of concerns
      - Facilitates unified development workflow
    consequences:
      positive:
        - Clear dependency management
        - Isolated feature development
        - Easy upstream updates
      negative:
        - More complex initial setup
        - Larger repository size
    alternatives_considered:
      - Single repository fork
      - Separate repositories with npm dependencies

  TD002:
    title: Integration Strategy
    date: '2024-01-24'
    status: proposed
    context: Need to determine how to integrate local-history into cursor-chat-browser UI
    decision: |
      Use API-first approach with React Portal integration:
      1. Create API layer for local-history
      2. Inject UI components via React Portal
      3. Maintain shared state management
    rationale: |
      - Minimizes changes to cursor-chat-browser
      - Enables progressive enhancement
      - Maintains clean separation
    consequences:
      positive:
        - Flexible integration points
        - Independent development
        - Clear boundaries
      negative:
        - Some performance overhead
        - More complex state management
    alternatives_considered:
      - Full UI replacement
      - Iframe integration
      - Shadow DOM approach
